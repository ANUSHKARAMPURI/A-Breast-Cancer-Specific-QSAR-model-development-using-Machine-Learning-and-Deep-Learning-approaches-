Breast cancer research has embraced AI in drug discovery, expediting development. 3D QSAR, blending classical and Machine Learning techniques, uses molecular descriptors from 2D and 3D small molecule structures to predict biological activity based on structural similarity. A specific QSAR model for breast cancer was developed using genomic data from 81 cell lines, sourced from CCLE and Cancer Dependency Map Portal, along with drug information from GDSC. Traditional QSAR models utilize IC50 and molecular descriptors, but incorporating genomic profiles enhances the model's ability to understand complex interactions between genomic parameters and molecular descriptors in each cell line. This approach improves prediction accuracy and reliability, allowing for personalized predictions. It also enables the classification of unknown cell lines based on mutational profiling, as the model is trained on genomic data from all existing breast cancer cell lines to date, making it a versatile tool for breast cancer research. For pancreatic, colon, and breast cancers, a drug repurposing approach involves creating a multicell-based QSAR model using data from GDSC2 (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer). This model predicts the functional activity and effectiveness of new drug molecules when combined with a reference molecule, along with synergy classification based on provided molecular descriptors. Cancer, marked by aberrant cell signaling culminating in uncontrolled cell proliferation, eludes the host's immune defenses and commandeers the replication and transcription apparatus for its survival and proliferation. An innovative approach involves the development of a QSAR model specifically tailored to target transcription factors. This model facilitates the prediction of drug inhibition coefficients for these precise transcriptional regulators. In summary, the fusion of AI technology with the creation of various QSAR models represents a significant breakthrough in cancer research and drug discovery. These models aren't just tools; they serve as pathways to precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies. They embody the potential to customize therapies according to the specific molecular profiles of individual patients, aiming for more potent, precisely targeted, and patient-oriented approaches in the fight against cancer.
