**What exactly is QSAR?**

Quantitative Structure-activity relationship (QSAR) is a ligand-based drug discovery method 
and a data-driven approach that considers the experimentally validated molecules' biological 
activity and drug information data, known as Molecular descriptors, for predicting on-target 
and off-target activities. It works on a hypothesis that molecules with similar structures tend to 
have similar biological activity by correlating the structure of the molecule with its activity. 
This process can help cut down the inactive molecules and help prioritize experiments with 
selected molecules in the early stages of drug development. There are various QSAR models 
based on the type of molecular descriptors considered(or based on how the molecule is 
being represented quantitatively) in the training set, such as 2-dimensional QSAR, 3-
dimensional QSAR , 4-dimensional QSAR. Molecular descriptors are the variables 
that quantitatively represent a molecule, and these can be Topological descriptors, Geometric 
descriptors, Electronic descriptors, Physicochemical descriptors, QSAR descriptors, chemical 
fingerprints, and Molecular fingerprints.

**Role of AI and ML in developing QSAR models**

Artificial intelligence has had remarkable development in the field of drug discovery in the last 
decade, especially Machine learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL). ML and 
DL were widely used as data-driven approaches in developing QSAR models targeting various 
diseases. Machine learning and deep learning methods are employed to develop a QSAR model to 
perform regression-based predictions of continuous variables such as Biological activity (IC50 
values). Traditional QSAR modeling involves calculating molecular descriptors for each drug 
molecule utilizing the data generated to train the ML algorithms. Trained Machine learning 
algorithms can predict the biological activity of novel molecules based on the respective drug 
molecule's structural information. R2 (Coefficient of determination), RMSE (Root Mean 
Square Error), MSE (Mean Square Error), and Fold Cross-validation scores will be evaluated 
for performance validations during regression-based machine learning predictions.
