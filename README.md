## **What is QSAR? üî¨**

**Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)** is a powerful ligand-based drug discovery method that leverages data-driven approaches to predict the biological activity of molecules. QSAR is grounded in the hypothesis that molecules with similar structures tend to exhibit similar biological activities. By correlating the molecular structure of compounds with their biological effects, QSAR models can predict both on-target and off-target activities.

### **üîç How Does QSAR Work?**
QSAR operates by analyzing experimentally validated molecules' biological activity data and drug information, known as molecular descriptors. These descriptors quantitatively represent various molecular properties and are crucial for predicting the activity of new compounds. By correlating the structure of a molecule with its activity, QSAR models help identify promising candidates and prioritize experiments in the early stages of drug development.

### **üìä Types of QSAR Models**
QSAR models vary based on the type of molecular descriptors considered in the training set:

- **2D QSAR:** Focuses on two-dimensional structural representations.
- **3D QSAR:** Incorporates three-dimensional molecular structures to consider spatial orientations.
- **4D QSAR:** Adds dynamic aspects by including conformational changes of molecules over time.

### **üî¨ Molecular Descriptors**
Molecular descriptors are the variables that quantitatively represent a molecule. These descriptors are categorized into various types:

- **Topological Descriptors:** Capture the connectivity and arrangement of atoms within the molecule.
- **Geometric Descriptors:** Focus on the shape, size, and spatial arrangement of the molecule.
- **Electronic Descriptors:** Reflect the electronic properties, such as charge distribution and dipole moments.
- **Physicochemical Descriptors:** Represent physical and chemical properties, such as hydrophobicity, polarity, and solubility.
- **Chemical and Molecular Fingerprints:** Encode the presence or absence of specific substructures within the molecule, aiding in similarity searches.

### **üîó Database Sources**
For QSAR model development and validation, reliable data sources are crucial. Here are some key databases:

- **GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer):** Provides comprehensive data on drug sensitivity in various cancer cell lines. 
  - [GDSC Combinations](https://gdsc-combinations.depmap.sanger.ac.uk/)
  - [GDSC Main Database](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/)
